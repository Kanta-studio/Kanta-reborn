# KANTA Reborn architecture

## Repository boundaries

`apps/ios` retains the original Swift app structure, project.yml, Package.swift, Sources, Resources and Tests. The original stage-ui snapshot is the selected baseline because it includes the latest recovered stage implementation; its missing files prevent a verified build. Original Apple bundle identities and iOS 17 minimum remain subject to the recovered project configuration.

`apps/android` is reserved for a native Android app. Kotlin/Gradle source is absent; a requirements document is included instead of invented original source. It will have its own build and signing configuration.

`recovery/ios/snapshots` contains other original snapshots without nested Git databases. They are evidence, not dependencies. Complete recovery ZIPs remain preserved separately. Historical source variants must be reconciled file by file.

`docs/evidence/website/2026-10-15` stores exact public-site bytes, extracted readable text and URL/SHA-256 manifest. It is evidence only, not a newly deployed website. No public song catalog may be added.

## Runtime contracts

Each platform has one playback controller and FIFO reservation queue. UI, lyrics, fullscreen/TV stage and companion control project that owner's state. Import and persistence run away from latency-sensitive playback/UI work; commits are atomic and stale async results cannot replace newer state. Retry suppression applies to the same operation ID, never separate intentional reservations.

Scoring is default off and observes dry microphone input without storing audio. Completion scores belong to immutable playback identities and are emitted only once. Monitoring and pitch processing are separate opt-in services and must mute on unsafe output routes. Source media and user SF2 are byte-preserved.

Companion commands require explicit pairing, authorization, bounded replay protection and revocation. Website descriptions conflict between older plaintext PIN control and newer encrypted Android pairing; do not implement or advertise cross-platform transport compatibility without an explicit reviewed protocol and tests.

## Build isolation

Historical `.github` directories nested inside app/recovery folders do not run as root GitHub workflows. Root CI is intentionally absent during recovery; future manual workflows must select a platform explicitly and use working-directory paths. Signing secrets never belong in Git.

## Shared material

Shared future files are limited to independently verified first-party assets and documented interoperability formats. Native playback state and UI code remain platform specific. The captured Songbook JavaScript may inform a compatibility specification; a claim of compatibility requires cross-platform fixture tests.
